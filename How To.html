      <p>Learning how to draw can seem daunting, especially when you look at masterpieces by your favorite artists. However, it's important to remember that even the great masters were beginners once. Start by practicing some basic drawing techniques, then move on to more complex drawings to capture people, landscapes, animals, and more. If you keep at it, you'll likely be surprised at how quickly your drawing skills improve!</p>

	   <h2>Method 1: How to Practice General Drawing Techniques</h2>
      
      <ol class="custom-counter">
        <img src="images/1a.jpg">
   	  <p><li class="number"> Start by drawing basic lines and curves. If you're just learning to draw, start by carefully drawing the pencil over the page in a straight line. Practice holding your hand at different angles to see what gives you the most control over the pencil, along with what feels most comfortable. Once you feel comfortable drawing a straight line, practice rotating your wrist as you draw, which should create a curve. Try making a series of big loops on the paper, then draw tiny swirls below that. This will help you build up your hand-eye coordination so you can create the effects you want on the page.
        </li></p>
       
        
   	    <ul>
   	 	    <li >Practice drawing lines of different lengths, thicknesses, and textures. Try to produce wavy lines, zig-zag lines, and tangled, scribbly lines.
   	 	    </li>
          <li>After you get comfortable with lines and curves, try drawing shapes. For instance, you might try filling a page with two-dimensional shapes such as circles, squares, or triangles.
          </li> For more information on drawing a straight line, check out How to Draw Neat Lines. 
        </li>
        </ul>
        

        <img src="images/2a.jpg">
        <li class="number">Create a sense of depth by shading in a shape. Draw a simple shape, such as a circle, and add an imaginary light source to your page. Use a pencil to lightly shade in the areas farthest from your light source, while leaving the area closest to the light source unshaded. Keep building up the shading until you have a gentle fade you have a gradient from the darkest values at the parts of the object farthest from the light source to the lightest at the area closest to the light source.
        </li>
        
        <ul>
          <li>For instance, you might imagine that there's a lamp shining down from the top left corner of the page. In that case, the top-left area of your shape wouldn't have any shading. Just below that area, add light shading then progress to very dark shadows in the bottom right corner of your page. </li>
          <li>Try blending your shadows with your finger, an eraser, or a cloth to soften them. </li>
          <li>To learn more about shading, check out How to Shade Drawings. You can also read about more advanced shading techniques in How to Cross-Hatch and How to Stipple.</li>
          
        </ul>
      </p>
        <img src="images/3a.jpg">
        <li>Make an object seem grounded in reality by adding cast shadows. Picture your light source, then draw a shadow on the opposite side of the object from the light. The shadow should be the same shape as the object, although it may be longer or shorter than the object itself, depending on how far away the light source is and the angle of the light.[4]
        </li>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>For instance, if you have a bowl of fruit on a table, the table will cast a shadow on the floor, the bowl will cast a shadow on the table, and the fruit will cast a shadow inside the bowl.</li>
            <li>Use your finger or an eraser to blur the edges of the shadow so it looks more realistic.</li>

          </ul>
          </p>
        <img src="images/5a.jpg">
        <li>Draw a grid on the paper if you need help with proportions. If you're drawing something from a source image, draw several evenly-spaced vertical and horizontal lines on your paper to make a grid. Then, draw the same lines on your source image. Look at each individual square on the source image and copy it into the corresponding square on your paper. Your finished picture should be proportionate with the original!</li>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>For instance, you might draw 3 vertical lines and 2 horizontal lines to make a 4x3 grid.</li>
            <li>It's okay if the squares aren't the same size on your source image as they are on your paper. You'll naturally adjust the size as you copy the picture you see in each grid. In fact, this technique is often used to resize a drawing.</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Method 2: How to Draw People and Faces</h2>
      
      <ol class="custom-counter">
        <img src="images/1b.jpg">
        <li>Sketch a large oval shape and a cross to draw a person's face up close. Draw an upside-down egg shape that's slightly narrower on the bottom and wider on the top. Then, lightly sketch a vertical and a horizontal line going through the oval.
        </li>
          <ul>
            <li>These lines will help you balance the proportions of the person's face. Draw them lightly, since you don't want them to show in the finished drawing.
             </li>

            <li>If you'd like to learn more, read How to Draw a Face.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <img src="images/2b.jpg">
        <li> Use the lines to sketch the person's facial features. Draw the person's eyes along the horizontal line and place the nose about halfway between the eyes and the bottom of the chin. Sketch eyebrows above the eyes, then add the ears so that the bottoms of the ears line up with the bottom of the nose, and the tops of the ears line up with the eyebrows.</li>
        </li>
          <ul>
            


        <img src="images/3b.jpg">
        <li>Focus on one-on-one interactions. It's unlikely that you'll be able to ever be truly solitary, but that doesn't mean you have to be a social butterfly. To keep your contacts as limited and controlled as possible, try to keep things one-on-one, as much as possible.
        </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Don't have birthday parties for yourself, spend time with a close friend, hanging out at home, or having dinner. If you're invited to a party, make contact with the host and tell them you can't come, but invite them for a one-on-one hang-out, if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>If you choose to date, make sure to be honest with people. If you're dating someone who likes to hang out with people on a regular basis, that might be a deal-breaker for both of you.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <img src="images/4b.jpg">
        <li>Suspend your social network accounts. try to make sure there's as little web record of you as possible. Cancel or suspend your social networking accounts for the time being, and delete them if you're serious about this antisocial thing.
        </li>
        <img src="images/5b.jpg">
        <li>Figure out your own solution to problems. The less you need to rely on other people for help, the more you'll be able to rely on yourself. Be as self-sufficient as possible and endeavor to find your own solutions to your problems, instead of asking other people for help.Google is your friend. If you don't know how to do something, research it and try to figure it out on your own. At least get informed about topics before you take it to an expert, or someone who's more experienced.
        </li>

        <img src="images/6b.jpg">
        <li>Know when to cut off relationships. In the movie Heat, Robert De Niro's bank robber likes to say that he doesn't have anything in his life he couldn't walk out on, if he saw the cops coming around the corner. If you want to live the solitary life, you've got to keep yourself unattached and distant. You might consider cutting off relationships when people get too close.
        </li>

        <img src="images/8b.jpg">
        <li>Be a minimalist. To move around and stay as mobile as possible, try to limit your belongings as well as your social interactions. Think of it this way: the less shopping you do, and the less stuff you need, the less you'll need to be around people and deal with the consequences of all that stuff. Limit your buying and selling as much as you can. Simplify.
        </li>

        <img src="images/10b.jpg">
        <li>Stop apologizing. You don't need to apologize for yourself and the way you are, or position yourself underneath others socially. If you're introverted and prefer being alone instead of going to parties and socializing, you don't need to attempt to "change" your behavior or yourself. Don't apologize for the way you are.
        </li>

      <h2>Part 3 of 3: Negotiating Common Social Interactions</h2>
      <ol class="custom-counter">
        <img src="images/1c.jpg">
        <li>Get through school. Negotiating your school career is a common problem for antisocial people. It's important to remember that you're not above your peers, your teachers, or anyone at your school. The more you can accept the things that make you alike, instead of focusing on the ways in which you're different, the easier getting through school will be.</li>
        <img src="images/2c.jpg">
        <li>
          Put your head down at work. The workplace can be another challenging environment for antisocial people. Having to deal with a variety of personalities and authority figures can tax anyone's social skills, especially if you prefer your own company. While lots of the specifics of negotiating your work day will have to do with your particular job, you can learn to do a few things to keep yourself happy and healthy.
        </li>
        <img src="images/3c.jpg">
        <li>Just make an appearance at parties, then leave. Big crowds of people yelling and dancing and screaming and taking selfies? Parties are a big bummer for introverts and antisocial people alike, and trying to negotiate invitations can cause stress and anxiety. Stop worrying about whether or not you'll let an acquaintance down by not showing up to the party because you want to stay home and read. Plan to make a quick stop in and then go back to doing what you want to do.</li>
        <img src="images/4c.jpg">
        <li>Time pick-ups better to avoid awkward chats. If you pick up your kids from school and want to avoid awkward, pointless conversations with the other parents while you wait, just learn to time your trip better to avoid having to wait for long periods of time. Grab a coffee on your way to the school and show up the moment school lets out. Wait in your car until you see your child, then make up an excuse to get going.</li>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Being asocial doesn't mean you can't have SOME friends, no matter what the dictionary says. Try to find one or two good friends and stick with them.</li>
      <li>Some asocial people are being anti-social unwilling (these people tend to be naturally shy and keep things to themselves). Try finding someone like this in your classes (shouldn't be hard, they'll probably be the only ones who don't talk very much) and watching how they act. Don't be like a stalker or anything, but try to see what it is that makes people not bring them into a conversation.</li>
    </ul>
  </div> 
  <div id= "five">
    <h2>Warnings</h2>
    <ul>
 	    <li>Being anti-social can turn on you. The unpopularity can make the whole school hate you, and in turn destroy your emotions.</li>
