	<p class="five">Five more books to be carried out to the car; your office door closes behind you and at that moment you turn invisible-not even a ghost in that hall</p>
	<h2 class="view">from that hall's point of view.</h2>
	<p class="class">If the hall's point of view.</p>
	<p class="and">If the halls don't know you, the halls and the rooms</p>
	<p class="the">of the buildings where you worked for seven years-</p>
	<p class="you">if the halls don't know you,</p>

	<p>											and they don't-</p>
	<p>some new woman or two new new men come clattering</p>
	<p>down these halls in the month after your departure, indeed</p>
	<p>just two days after you left forever</p>
	<p>they come clattering with ideas about</p>
	<p>the relation between mind and body or will and fate</p>
	<p>filled with hormones of being the chosen workers here</p>
	<p>and they feel as if the halls and rooms begin to recognize them</p>
	<p>accept them, as if there is a belonging in the world</p>

	<p>but these new workers are wrong, the halls don't know</p>
	<p>who is working under the unobtrusive florescent panels:</p>
