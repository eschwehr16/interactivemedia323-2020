	<p>Five more books to be carried out to the car;</p>
	<p>your office door closes behind you and at that moment</p>

	<p>you</p> 
	<p>turn</p> 
	<p>invisible-</p>

	<p>not even a ghost in that hall from the hall's point of view</p>
	<p>If the halls don't know you, the halls and the rooms of the buildings where you worked for seven years-</p>
	<p>if the halls don't know you,</p>

	<p>and</p> 
	<p>they</p> 
	<p>don't</p> 

	<p>some new woman or two men come clattering down these halls in the month after your departure,</p>
	<p>indeed just two days after you left forever</p>
	<p>they come clattering with ideas about the relation between</p>

	<p>mind &</p>
	<p>body</p>

	<p>or</p>

	<p>will &</p>
	<p>fate</p>

	<p>filled with hormones of being the chosen workers here and they feel as if the halls and rooms begin to recognize them,</p>
	<p>accept them,</p>
	<p>as if there is a belonging in the world</p>

	<p>but these new workers are wrong, the halls don't know who is working under the</p>
	<p>unobtrusive</p>
	<p>florescent</p>
	<p>panels:</p>
