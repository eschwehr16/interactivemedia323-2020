    <p>Learning how to draw can seem daunting, especially when you look at masterpieces by your favorite artists. However, it's important to remember that even the great masters were beginners once. Start by practicing some basic drawing techniques, then move on to more complex drawings to capture people, landscapes, animals, and more. If you keep at it, you'll likely be surprised at how quickly your drawing skills improve!</p>

  <h2>Method 1: How to Practice General Drawing Techniques</h2>

      <p><li class="number">Start by drawing basic lines and curves. If you're just learning to draw, start by carefully drawing the pencil over the page in a straight line. Practice holding your hand at different angles to see what gives you the most control over the pencil, along with what feels most comfortable. Once you feel comfortable drwing a straight line, practice rotating your wrist as you draw, which should create a curve. Try makinga series of big loops on the paper, then draw tiny swirls below that. This will help you build up your hand-eye coordination so you can create the effects you want on the page.

      <ul>
        <li>Practice drawing lines of different lengths, thicknesses, and textures. Try to produce wavy lines, zig-zag lines, and tangled, scribbly lines.</li> 
        <li>After you get comfortable with lines and curves, try drawing shapes. For instance, you might try filling a page with two-dimensional shapes such as circles, squares, or triangles.</li>
